# Health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction-Vehicle-insurance-Prediction-


In this project, we were working on “Predicting Health Insurance Owners’ who will be
interested in Vehicle Insurance”. We have used the health insurance cross-sell prediction dataset from Kaggle . The insurance company who had provided the health
insurance to the customers now wanted to predict who will be interested in buying the vehicle insurance. We choose this data - to understand how the cross-sell policy can be useful for the organization and how analytics can prove to be one of the essentials in doing this by analyzing the data and targeting the right people to buy the insurance policy.
